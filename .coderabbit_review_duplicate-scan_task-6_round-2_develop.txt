Prompt for AI Agent:
In tests/test_home_view.py around lines 112 to 127, test_clear_folders calls HomeView.add_folder with literal paths but does not mock pathlib.Path validation, so the test may fail on machines where those paths don't exist; update the test to patch/mocking pathlib.Path.exists and pathlib.Path.is_dir (or HomeView._is_valid_folder) to return True for the test paths (using monkeypatch or unittest.mock.patch) before calling add_folder, then perform clear_folders and assertions, and ensure the patches are applied only for the duration of the test (teardown/context manager) so filesystem checks are simulated reliably across environments.
